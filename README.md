# Flat Earth

 A python-based NoCMS which produces flat HTML sites from Markdown files and directory structure.

## Why?

I spend a lot of my time in the command line so producing content via a repository and git is much quicker and easier than logging into a Wordpress site and editing there. Plus there's the history of the article in the commit messages for transparency.
